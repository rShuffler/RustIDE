# LumaIDE
IDE on Rust

# About LumaIDE

The project is trying to revive Atom IDE but in safe Rust language. So far we are trying to improve the editor and add new functionality. 

# How to work with the project?

The project is based on Rust 2021, please do not change the version as it will break the functionality of the project. And so, to start working with the project you need to download the project on our githab (that is its Source code), then, open it in a convenient editor, it can be VS Code or something else, then you can work with it, you can improve the interface, add functionality and so on.

# What are the limitations?

1. Your project must be open source and must be posted on github or gitlab.
2. Your project must not contain 18+ content
